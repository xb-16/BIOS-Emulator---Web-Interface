# About
I had an idea for a long time, but delays prevented me from implementing it,so I decided to do what i set out to do.
after 7 days of continued work we got this : BIOS Emulator as Web Interface.

It simulates the old BIOS screen and turns it into a web page screen that can be interacted using keyboard buttons
Please browse the screen from your computer to get better browsing experience
You can press the buttons such as **ArrowUp**, **ArrowDown**, **ArrowRight**, **ArrowLeft**, **Enter**, **Space**, **F1**, **F10**, **F9**, **Esc**.

**Font used**: _Perfect DOS VGA 437_
